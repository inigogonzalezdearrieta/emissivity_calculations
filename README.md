# emissivity_calculations
Jupyter notebooks for emissivity data processing (uncertainties, integrals, plotting).

I have developed these software tools during my PhD at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). In the beginning, I could not find appropriate open-source resources for the data treatment that I needed.
